# Legacy n8n Pipeline

The pipeline receives print jobs from the backend and is responsible for automated preprocessing of 3D prints, vetting and safety checks (whether the print is 
appropriate) before being actually sent to the printers. Processing scripts include auto orient, image extraction for NSFW AI vision model checks and slicing.

The current pipeline uses a self hosted docker container of an n8n instance to execute a linear workflow for the vetting process for ensure the STL files are safe and printable,
before actually sending them to the 3DQue printers via the 3DQue API, which is also locally hosted.

# Workflow 

1. Backend POSTs request via an API gateway to the n8n instance 

```JSON
{
    "title": string,
    "description": string,
    "formAnswers": {
        "purpose": string,
        "design_intent": "functional" | "visual" | "structural",
    },
    "jobId": string,
    "status" "RUNNING",
    "category": string,
    "file": {

    },
}
```

TODO: check docs for format! 

2. Backend sends to file to the local SeeweedFS S3 compatible bucket 
3. The pipeline webhook receives the backend POST request, which sends the metadata of the print job including the filename (the key) for retrieving the raw file from the bucket
4. If the pipeline is saturated or busy, n8n handles queuing of jobs internally using Redis, and processes job in a First In First Out (FIFO) manner 
5. n8n pulls the raw file from the bucket for the corresponding print job it starts on 
6. Images are extracted from the raw 3D file via a Python script using OpenSCAD
7. The images are sent to a Vision language Model as a microservice; if the vision language model (VLM) returns a positive classification, the pipeline terminates and POSTs the result of the printjob including the metadata to the backend, otherwise the pipeline continues after receiving a response from the VLM
8. Based on the metadata of the print request, slicer profile settings are applied 
9. The 3D model is auto oriented for the best position for slicing using the Tweaker 3 CLI 
10. The 3D model is sliced, and then sent to 3DQue's queuing system for printing 
11. n8n has its own internal Postgres container to keep track of the system. All data is centralized to the MariaDB backend, so after each print job, the status of the print job is POST'ed to the backend, and n8n logs for each print job are given a TTL and removed after a week
